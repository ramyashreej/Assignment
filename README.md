Linked lists

Write a C program that uses a linked list to hold and print a list of words.
The program shall take words of up to 30 characters, one per line, followed by a comma and the position in the list where the word should be inserted. If no comma is present, the word should be inserted at the end of the list. (use fgets() )
Store each one in a linked list.
All words (duplicate or otherwise) will be stored. Example input: turtle, 5
When the user enters '$' on a line by itself, the program will stop taking new words
Then the program will print the words in the order of the list.
